        <p class = "text">I am Archana Vellanki. I am from Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh and I have done my schooling 
            and intermediate from the same place. I have done my BTech from JNTU 
            College of Engineering, Anantapur. Post my btech I worked for 2 years at Accenture. 
            I came to know about this course through my relatives and attempted the entrance exam in which I secured 3rd rank.
            It was my mom and sister who inspired me to join this course.</p>
